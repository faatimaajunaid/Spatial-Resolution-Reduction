# Spatial-Resolution-Reduction
Spatial reduction using averaging, median and decimation using GUI

We took an input image (color/grey-level) and the size for spatial resolution reduction (e.g. from 1024x1024 to 512x512 / 256x256) while keeping the canvas size constant and performed the following operations each for generating the following three versions:

1. Averaging
2. Median
3. Decimation
